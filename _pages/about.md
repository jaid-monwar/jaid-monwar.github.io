Hello! I recently graduated from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/).

I am currently a research intern at two labs: the IntelligentCATLab at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I am advised by [Prof. Reyhaneh Jabbarvand](https://reyhaneh.cs.illinois.edu/), and the LUCID Lab at Towson University, working under the guidance of [Prof. Khandakar Ashrafi Akbar](https://www.towson.edu/cla/departments/computerscience/facultystaff/akbar.html).

At the IntelligentCATLab, I am developing a framework for generating unit tests across multiple programming languages (C, Java, and Python). Meanwhile, at the LUCID Lab, I am working on leveraging LLMs to generalize logs from various sources. I am also actively involved in a research project focused on generating UI test scripts from natural language test cases.

Outside of my academic research, I love hacking new ideas and bringing them to life. This passion for building is why I am also a Software Engineer at a startup called Yobo AI, creating cool AI voice agents. On a completely unrelated note, my favorite movie is Transformers (ðŸ¤–).
